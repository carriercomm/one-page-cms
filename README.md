One page CMS
============

An insanely small, single file, PHP Sqlite3 CMS.

This editor was designed for people who want to create simple webpages for friends in HTML and CSS, while giving their friends the power to change the content. It would probably work well for small businesses or organizations where updating small pieces of content takes up much more developer time than creating the actual site.


Installation
------------

1. Set $secret variable in config.php
2. Visit index.php?editor=$secret to page edit content
